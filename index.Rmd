# Reading data frames from files using code

The main data set we are looking at is the World Happiness Report (2017 & 2019), by country. The files are [WHR_2019.xlsx](WHR_2019.xlsx), [WHR_2017.xlsx](WHR_2017.xlsx), [WHR_2019.csv](WHR_2019.csv), [WHR_2017.csv](WHR_2017.csv).

The "anthems" dataset is [here](anthems.csv).

The .Rmd file is [here](index.Rmd)


```{r Read in data, message = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

df.2017 <- readxl::read_excel("WHR_2017.xlsx") # Read an excel file

df.2017 <- read_csv("WHR_2017.csv") # Read from a .csv file

df.2019 <- readxl::read_excel("WHR_2019.xlsx") # Read an excel file

df.2019 <- read_csv("WHR_2019.csv") # Read from a .csv file

```

# Recap on piping

## Subsetting with base R

We're going to *subset* the WHR dataset (i.e. choose only those cases/observations which fulfil a specific criterion). To do this we're going to use the `which()` function. When you apply `which` to a variable in a dataset, it will produce indices (indexes) of the rows which fulfil a certain criterio, e.g. `which(df$var_name == 2)` will give you the indices of all rows where the value of the variable is 2.

## Subsetting the hard way!

Armed with this knowledge, your task is to subset the data frame so that it only contains information from African countries.

If you're stuck have a look at the answer below. 

```{r Subsetting the hard way}
df.Africa <- df.2019[which(df.2019$region == "Africa"), ]
```

## Piping

Okay, the above code is pretty horrible to look at, so we're going to explore an alternative using the package `dplyr` which is from the `tidyverse`. But before we can use `dplyr` we have to learn how to 'pipe'.

![](MagrittePipe.jpg)

Pipes are written in R as `%>%` (note you must use a percentage sign before and after the pipe). To demonstrate what pipes do, I have a look at the following pseudocode.

![](piping.png)

All pipes do is enable us to 'pass' a data frame (or another object) to a new function without having to keep on specifying the data frame. In addition, we can *chain* pipes together indefinitely. Finally we can `try before we buy`, i.e. we can test the pipe wihtout creating a new data frame.

Here's how we would subset the data frame using piping:

```{r Subsetting using tidyverse}

df.2017.Africa <- filter(df.2017, region == "Africa") # This is the version without piping

df.2017 %>%
  filter(region == "Africa") -> df.2017.Africa

# This is the version with piping. It looks longer, but we can chain multiple functions together!
```

Note that to create a new data frame, we need a solid arrow at the end. If we don't include that solid arrow, the results are shown in the console, but no new data frame is created. This is an incredibly useful feature of pipes. You can `try before you buy`!

And here is an example where we *chain* a series of pipes together:

```{r piping example}

df.2017 %>% 
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(mean.happiness = mean(happiness_score)) ->
  df.2017.mean.happiness.by.region

```

NB When piping the code becomes more readable when the line ends with the pipe.

There are a couple of important points to note.

(1) We can refer to variables without specifying the data frame
(2) If we wish to store the results we must output them using and arrow `->`. If we don't store the results they will merely be displayed in the console.

Piping is a key technique in R and once you've learnt it you will write much more powerful and readable code.

As well as using pipes to create data frame, you can also insert pipes into both analyses and figures! Here are some examples

```{r ANOVA and `tidy` command}

# An ANOVA without a pipe. NB we are using the base function "aov". If you would like to conduct SPSS-style ANOVAs, the best package is called "afex".

mod <- aov(happiness_rank ~ region, data = df.2017)

pacman::p_load(broom) # To load the "tidy" function.

tidy(mod)
```

```{r ANOVA with piping and `tidy` command}

# Here we use a pipe inside the analysis
mod <- aov(happiness_rank ~ region, # NB note we can break the line after a comma
           data = df.2017 %>% filter(region == "Africa" | region == "South America"))

tidy(mod)

```

```{r Plot GDP per capita against happiness for Europe, South America, and South East Asia (2019 data)}

df.2017 %>% 
  select(country, region) ->
  df.country.region

df.2019 %>%
  merge(df.country.region, by.x = "Country or region", by.y = "country") ->
  df.2019

g <- ggplot(aes(x = `GDP per capita`, y = Score, colour = region), # NB note we can break the line after a comma
            data = df.2019  %>% 
                   filter(region == "Europe" | region == "South America" | region == "South East Asia")
            )
g <- g + geom_point()
g <- g + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
g


```

Note how I have broken some of the lines after a comma. This makes the code more readable. Generally we can break a line when it ends in some kind of symbol, e.g. a pipe, an arrow, or a comma.


# Loops and if-then statements

Loops and if-then statements are useful programming tools which have the same structure: `FUNCTION (STATEMENT) {.....}`.

## Loops

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/MDXomrcGshGso/giphy.gif)

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  print(as.character(i))
}
```


## Loops

The code below creates a sequence ranging from 0 to 30 going up in steps of 0.25. Try to achieve the same result using a loop

```{r}
seq(0,30,2.5)
```


To demonstrate a loop we're going to look at the WHR data set. We're going to ask the question 'for different regions of the world, what is the relationship between GDP per capita nd happiness?

Here's how we would do it

```{r looping through regions and exploring correlation between GDP and happiness}

# This code drops regions where number of observations are less than 3 (we can't do correlations if there are less than 3 observations)

df.2019 %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(n > 3) ->
  region_list

# Here is the code with the loop
for (i in 1:nrow(region_list)){
  
 model <- cor.test(~ Score + `GDP per capita`,
                   data = df.2019 %>% 
                          filter(region == region_list$region[i])) 
 print(paste("Region: ", region_list$region[i])) # We print the results
 print(model)
}

```


```{r as above, in purrr}

pacman::p_load(purrr)

df.2019 %>%
  split(.$region) %>% # from base R
  map(~ lm(Score ~ `GDP per capita`, data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")

```

# EXERCISE

(1) Which countries experienced the greatest increases / decreases in happiness?
(2) Do countries whose national anthems mention the words "happy" / "happiness" have higher levels of happiness?

```{r increases and decreases}


g <- ggplot(data = df.2017 %>% 
                   merge(df.2019, by.x = "country", by.y = "Country or region") %>% 
                   mutate(difference = happiness_score - Score) %>% 
                   arrange(desc(difference)) %>% 
                   mutate(rank = row_number())
            )

g <- g + aes(x = rank, y = difference, label = country, colour = region.x)
g <- g + geom_point()
g <- g + geom_text(angle = 45, nudge_x = 0.5, hjust =0, vjust = 0, size = 2)
g

```
```{r national anthems}

df.anthems <- read_csv("anthems.csv")

contains.happy <- function(x){
  return(str_detect(x, "happ"))
}

df.2019 %>%
  merge(df.anthems, by.x = "Country or region", by.y = "Country") %>% 
  mutate(contains.happy = as.numeric(contains.happy(Anthem))) %>% 
  summary(lm(Score ~ contains.happy, data = .))
  

mod <- lm(Score ~ contains.happy,
                          df.2019 %>%
                            merge(df.anthems, by.x = "Country or region", by.y = "Country") %>% 
                            mutate(contains.happy = as.numeric(contains.happy(Anthem)))
)

summary(mod)

```
